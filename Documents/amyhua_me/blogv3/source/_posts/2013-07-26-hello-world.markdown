And...

    def hello_world
      print "Hello World"
    end
    
Begin.

My name is Amy Hua, and this is my brand spankin' new blog.
I've got a lot of ambitions for this baby. It doesn't look so
great right now, but it will soon. This website will serve as
my coding journal, my portfolio, and my museum of digital history.
Be prepared for self obsession (but hey, you asked for it: what
else would you expect out of a self-titled .me website?).

Broadly speaking, hacking to me refers to the practice of clever 
invention and design. To hack is to take a series of seemingly unlikely
combinations of components and *make* something out of it.
Hacking comes in many forms: code, travel, food, and life.

Most of my code will be written in Ruby on Rails (currently 3.2.13). Sometimes, I dabble in
Javascript, Node, HTML, and/or CSS, but mostly Ruby on Rails.
I'd love to see this site grow along with the general development 
of the life of myself and my code.

This is me, Amy Hua.

Welcome to AmyHua.me.
